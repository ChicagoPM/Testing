class: center, middle

# What? Why? How? and When?

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# What?

---
class: center, middle

# Make sure your code works

---
class: center, middle

# User testing
(make them work for it)

---
class: center, middle

# Writing code to make sure your code works

---
class: center, middle

# Unit testing
(in isolation)

---
class: center, middle

# Writing code to make sure your entire application works together

---
class: center, middle

# Integration testing
(all together now)

---
class: center, middle

# Writing code to make sure your UI works

---
class: center, middle

# UI testing
(that was obvious)

---
class: center, middle

# Have a program run your tests automatically

---
class: center, middle

# Continuous Integration
(hudson/jenkins, buildbot)

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Why?

---
class: center, middle

# To make sure your code works

---
class: center, middle

# To make sure your code still works later

---
class: center, middle

# To make sure your code works after you change something

---
class: center, middle

# To make it easier to change something

---
class: center, middle

# To show your users that your code works

---
class: center, middle

# Remember: You're your own user

(so why are you hitting yourself?)

---
class: center, middle

# To show your boss your code works
(but your tests might have a bug)
